# Brain-Tumor Predicton

### About

This is a brain-tumor prediction model which predicts wheather 
the x-ray of a brain has tumor has or not.

# Technologies Used

- PYTHON
- FLASK
- OpenCV-Python
- TensorFlow
- Pillow

# Steps for Project 

1. Downloaded Dataset from Kaggel.
2. Make folders for images having and not having tumor respectively.
3. Done some analysis and vizualised the dataset.
4. Did some data augmentation to remove the data imbalance.
5. Preprocessed the data to remove extra black pixels from the images.
6. Splitted the data and built models.
7. Final model is trained by loading weights from previous models.
